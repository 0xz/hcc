README for TestBolt
===================
This is a temporary sample to show the following separate functionalities 
which is controlled by 'using_plugin' flag in the CMakeLists.txt.
  (1) Bolt with CLAMP is working. when using_plugin = 0 (default value)
  (2) STL calls replacement with Bolt counterparts is working. when using_plugin = 1

The main reason to have such a flag is that CLAMP has not supported clang-plugin
in its driver yet. And manually setting this flag can show results when with or without
clang-plugin loadded.


******************************************************************************************
TODO
  Once the CLAMP driver has added supports of clang-plugin in compilation stage, viz StmtRewriter
  this sample will be moved to other place. And this TestBolt folder will be oboselte for good.
******************************************************************************************


Bolt with CLAMP (before replacement)
===================
To build and run the sample,
  a. set using_plugin to be 0
  b. ensure TestBolt.cpp is using STL calls only or it is in its checkout status
  b. build the sample by the command in the terminal:
     make
  c. If successful, the executable is in (PROJECT_BUILD_FOLDER)/build/Release/bin folder,
     where (PROJECT_BUILD_FOLDER) represents where to build cppamp-driver-ng.
  d. Run the executable:
     ./TestBolt


STL calls replacement
===================
To build and run the sample,
  a. ensure TestBolt folder is reverted to its checkout status
  b. ensure TestBolt.cpp is using STL calls only
  c. set using_plugin to be 1
  d. build the sample:
     make
  e. This build shall fail as expected for the reason CLAMP driver has not supported clang-plugin
  yet. However, TestBolt.cpp is now rewritten with Bolt calls by the clang-plugin. 
  Make sure the replacement has happend in this stage.
  f. Then, see if the rewritten TestBolt.cpp can be built or not:
     set using_plugin to be 0
  g. build the sample:
     make
  h. The rebuild shall be ok. And run the new executable in the folder as mentioned above:
    ./TestBolt


As reference sample's running result is as follows, (Before and after replacement is the same)
