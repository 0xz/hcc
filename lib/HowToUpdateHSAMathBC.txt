hsa_math.bc is compiled from lib/hsa_math.ll, using llvm-as from
https://github.com/HSAFoundation/HLC-HSAIL-Development-LLVM/tree/hsail-1.0f

(1) clone hlc compiler
    git clone https://github.com/HSAFoundation/HLC-HSAIL-Development-LLVM

(2) checkout to hsail-1.0f branch
    git checkout hsail-1.0f

(3) build hlc
    cd (path-to-hlc-build)
    cmake (path-to-hlc-source)

(4) Before building hsa_math.bc,
    ensure llvm-as is the one you newly build and not from pre-built
    or other installation package

    It is safe to run with a full path instead of a headless command, e.g.
    (path-to-your-build)/bin/llvm-as --version
      - LLVM version 3.6svn

(5) Use the generated llvm-as to generate hsa_math.bc
    (path-to-hlc-build)/bin/llvm-as (path-to-hcc-source)/lib/hsa_math.ll
